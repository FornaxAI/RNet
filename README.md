# FornaxAI's RNet

### Introduction

**Check out RNet v0.1's first demo [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZ12vIpCjqM)**

- RNet uses it's own special algorithm to find ground truth of given video. By using that, we don't need to specify the road lane markings manually.
- RNet's special ground truth finding algorithm helps us to create dataset much faster than manually creating dataset.
- For example, we've trained RNet v0.1 with 24K train and 24K validation images. All these images are taken from 5 5 minutes long video. For each 5 minute video, it took almost 7 minutes to get train and test images. (Each video contains almost 4500 frames.)

### FornaxAI's RNet can be used in
- Self driving car
- Lane assisting
- Autonomous delivery vehicles and many more areas that requires drive assist.
