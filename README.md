### Training FornaxAI's RNet

- RNet uses it's own special algorithm to find ground truth of given video. By using that, we don't need to specify the road lane markings manually.
- RNet's special ground truth finding algorithm helps us to create dataset much faster than manually creating dataset.
- The must-have dataset to train RNet was developed by FornaxAI.

### FornaxAI's RNet can be used in

- Self driving car
- Lane assisting
- Autonomous delivery vehicles and many more areas that requires drive assist.
